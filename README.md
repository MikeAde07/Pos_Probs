# Pos_Probs

* Adeniran, Michael 1002232183
* Python 3 is used for this task
* Code breaks up the hypothese and probabilities into dictionary data structures and processed through 2 main functions to iterate through the dictionaries and perform mathematical operations to determine the next probabilites. The 2nd function writes the results to the text file.
* The program runs with a single command line argument. In the command line type "python compute_a_posteriori.py '(strings)'" and the probabilites after each observation will be displayed in the resulting text file.
